The following files were loaded as part of the run_analysis.R script:

1. 'features.txt': List of all features.
2. 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
3. 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
4. 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
5. 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
6. 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
7. 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
8. 'test/subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

The final data set is written into "TidyData.txt" in the workspace folder.

Analysis Outline:
-----------------

1. The training and test data sets are loaded from the files "xtest.txt", "ytest.txt", "xtrain.txt", "ytrain.txt".
2. The features data which consists of the various kinds of measurements is loaded from "features.txt"
3. The names of the columns of the xtest and xtrain datasets is mapped to the features data.
4. The activity labels which consists of the kind of activities performed in the experiment is loaded from "activity_labels.txt"
5. The levels of the activity labels is specified in the correct order and with descriptive labels.
6. The ytest and ytrain data is coerced as a factor. The levels of these factors are mapped to the activity labels factor. 
7. The names of the ytest and ytrain are appropriately named as "Activity"
8, The xtest and ytest data is combined to form one dataframe. Similar action is performed on the training dataset.
9. The Subject data for both the training and test datasets is loaded and combined with the respective data frames.
10. The training and test datasets are merged using the rbind command.
11. The unwanted columns are removed by searching for only the column names containing the mean or std string.
12. The column names are rationalized using the make.names function to make them compatible with R.
13. The tidy data set with the averages calculated for the measurements is generated. 
14. The tidy data is melted to form a long data set with the Subject and Activity as ID Vars.
